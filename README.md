300 images of human face, illusory face and matched non-face object stimuli.

Three behavioural tasks and neural measurements (EEG) using these stimuli.

- Spontaneous dissimilarity: triplet odd-one-out task
- Face-like ratings: participants were asked to rate how easily they could see a face in the image, on a scale of 0-10. 
- Face/object discrimination: speeded categorisation task
- EEG: Stimuli were presented centrally at 3.75 Hz, while participants performed an orthogonal target detection task
