Robinson AK, Stuart G, Shatek SM, Herbert A, Taubert J. (2025). How the spontaneous perception of face pareidolia unfolds over time.

300 images of human face, illusory face and matched non-face object stimuli.

Three behavioural tasks and neural measurements (EEG) using these stimuli.

- Spontaneous dissimilarity: triplet odd-one-out task
- Face-like ratings: participants were asked to rate how easily they could see a face in the image, on a scale of 0-10. 
- Face/object discrimination: speeded categorisation task
- EEG: Stimuli were presented centrally at 3.75 Hz, while participants performed an orthogonal target detection task
